3. Let's start from an example: In a running `Zookeeper` system, the serializer inside the leader processor gets stuck when dumping snapshot to another instance due to a transient network error. However, the serializer still holds the lock, which blocks the request processor module. Since the fail detector module is not affected, it still keeps sending heartbeats to other processes. Thus, this process appears to be working properly. From the view of an on-call engineer who maintains the `ZooKeeper` cluster, he/she finds that some services relying on `ZooKeeper` are experiencing a lot of time-outs. When he/she tries to inspect the issue, the whole service looks normally, he can still read from the server but read or update operations suffer time-outs. No obvious error can be inferred from log files.
